About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Thang Nguyen, currently a Computer Science student at Santa Fe College (2024â€“2028).
I have a strong passion for technology, programming, and building useful software products. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and collaborate on interesting projects. On my GitHub, youâ€™ll find my coding experiments, personal projects, and contributions to open-source communities.

Feel free to connect and share ideas!
